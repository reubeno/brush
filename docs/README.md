# brush documentation

The docs are grouped into:

* [How-to guides](how-to/README.md)
* [Tutorials](tutorials/README.md)
* [Reference material](reference/README.md)

If you're just getting started building this project, you should consult the [How to Build](how-to/build.md) guide.

> _Note: The structure of our docs is inspired by the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach; we've found over time that best helps readers find the material most relevant to them, as well as provides a rough shape for where to place the right docs._
