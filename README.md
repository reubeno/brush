## About

`brush` is an `sh` implementation with aspirations of compatibility with the [POSIX Shell specification](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html) as well as with [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

It's not there right now, but very much a work in progress.
